### What Is *Magic: The Gathering*?

*Magic: The Gathering* was the first collectible trading card game ever made,
created by Wizards of the Coast in 1993. It has been regularly releasing
expansions to its collection of cards for over 25 years, and is played in both
physical and digital formats.

Two players construct a deck of 60 cards full of creatures, lands, artifacts,
and more and battle against each other to bring their opponent's life total
from 20 to 0. With over 20,000 unique cards, the possibilities are daunting,
trying to find the best combination of cards. The players who are able to find
these combinations, and play them optimally, will eventually be invited to
*Magic's* premier tournament: the *Magic* World Championship.
